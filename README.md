# balearic_football_players

This project aims to analyze data about football players born in the Balearic Islands (Spain). This Repository will be updated eventually adding
notebooks with new insights.

Currently it's composed by two notebooks:

Scrapping.ipynb contains the code to prepare the datasets. Mostly is a web scraping process from BDfutbol.com.

Scorers_evolution_Animation.ipynb contains the data processing to create a bar chart race from scorers along the time.
